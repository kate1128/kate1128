[基本环境配置](https://www.yuque.com/qiaokate/su87gb/kwr2le446w124rlu)

## 基础RAG通道
1. 把 documents 中各个文档的文本连接成一个字符串，然后创建一个 Document 实例，这个实例代表整个文档的集合。

```python
from llama_index import Document

document = Document(text="\n\n".join([doc.text for doc in documents]))
```

2. 把中文标点符号替换成英文标点符号，方便后续处理

```python
# 将中文标点符号替换成英文标点符号，方便后续处理
# 如果是英文文档，可以跳过这一步
# 不处理的话，会导致无法正确切分中文句子，会影响后续sentence_window的大小，导致输入长度大于gpt-3.5-turbo的最大限制
document.text=document.text.replace('。','. ')
document.text=document.text.replace('！','! ')
document.text=document.text.replace('？','? ')
```

3. 创建`llm`、`service_context`、`index`

<br/>color2
下列代码解析：

+ `llm`使用 `OpenAI` 类创建了一个 `GPT-3.5-turbo` 模型的实例，并设置了温度参数为 `0.1`
+ `service_context`使用 `ServiceContext` 类创建了一个服务上下文实例，包含了前面创建的 `GPT-3.5-turbo` 模型以及指定的嵌入模型。
+ `index`使用 `VectorStoreIndex.from_documents` 方法，基于之前创建的文档和服务上下文，创建了一个向量存储索引。

<br/>

```python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index import ServiceContext
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI

# llm使用 OpenAI 类创建了一个 GPT-3.5-turbo 模型的实例，并设置了温度参数为 0.1
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.1)

# service_context使用 ServiceContext 类创建了一个服务上下文实例，
# 包含了前面创建的 GPT-3.5-turbo 模型以及指定的嵌入模型。
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(
    llm=llm, embed_model="local:BAAI/bge-small-zh-v1.5"
)

# index使用 VectorStoreIndex.from_documents 方法，
# 基于之前创建的文档和服务上下文，创建了一个向量存储索引。
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents([document],
                                        service_context=service_context)
```

4. 将之前**创建**的向量存储索引转换为**查询引擎**，以便后续进行查询操作。

```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

```

5. 使用查询引擎执行了一个查询操作，查询给定的问题。

```python
response = query_engine.query(
    "在寻找项目以积累经验时应采取哪些步骤?"
)
print(str(response))
```

<details class="lake-collapse"><summary id="u7720f03e"><span class="ne-text">output：</span></summary><pre data-language="json" id="FzPkf" class="ne-codeblock language-json"><code>在寻找项目以积累经验时，应该首先明确制定目标并确保能够实现这些目标。然后需要建立一个可预测的世界模型，将整个世界状态用数学模型表现出来，并能够预测它们的行为将如何改变这个世界。在多Agent中，可以通过合作和竞争的方式去完成一定的目标，利用演化算法和群体智能来达成一个整体的突现行为目标。最后，需要通过智能推理来得到新的知识，结合先验知识和特定的推理规则，以便积累更多经验。</code></pre></details>
##  使用`Trulens`进行评测
```python
eval_questions = []
with open('data/eval_questions.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        # Remove newline character and convert to integer
        item = line.strip()
        print(item)
        eval_questions.append(item)
```

加上自定义问题

```python
# You can try your own question:
new_question = "什么是适合我的人工智能工作?"
eval_questions.append(new_question)
```

加入以后现在的列表打印：

```python
eval_questions
```

通过调用 `reset_database()` 方法重置 `Trulens` 数据库。清空之前的记录和反馈数据。

```python
from trulens_eval import Tru
tru = Tru()

tru.reset_database()
```

<details class="lake-collapse"><summary id="u3ffe9390"><span class="ne-text">output：</span></summary><pre data-language="json" id="NplXE" class="ne-codeblock language-json"><code>🦑 Tru initialized with db url sqlite:///default.sqlite .

使用 `get_prebuilt_trulens_recorder` 函数创建一个 `Trulens` 记录器 (`tru_recorder`)，该记录器与给定的查询引擎 (`query_engine`) 相关联。同时，指定了应用程序的标识为 "`Direct Query Engine`"。

```python
from utils import get_prebuilt_trulens_recorder

tru_recorder = get_prebuilt_trulens_recorder(query_engine,
                                             app_id="Direct Query Engine")

```

使用 `tru_recorder` 记录器开始记录过程，遍历 `eval_questions` 列表，对每个问题进行查询，并将查询引擎的响应记录下来。

```python
with tru_recorder as recording:
    for question in eval_questions:
        response = query_engine.query(question)
```

获取 `Trulens` 记录和反馈数据。用于后续分析和评估。

```python
records, feedback = tru.get_records_and_feedback(app_ids=[])
```

```python
records.head()
```

运行 Trulens 仪表板以可视化评估结果。

```python

##  高级的RAG通道
### 滑窗句子检索
创建 OpenAI 的 GPT-3.5-turbo 语言模型实例：

```python
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.1)
```

使用辅助函数 `build_sentence_window_index` 创建基于窗口的句子索引：

```python
from utils import build_sentence_window_index

sentence_index = build_sentence_window_index(
    document,
    llm,
    embed_model="local:BAAI/bge-small-zh-v1.5",
    save_dir="sentence_index"
)
```

使用辅助函数 `get_sentence_window_query_engine` 获取基于句子窗口的查询引擎：

```python
from utils import get_sentence_window_query_engine

sentence_window_engine = get_sentence_window_query_engine(sentence_index)
```

```python
def get_sentence_window_query_engine(
    sentence_index,
    similarity_top_k=6,
    rerank_top_n=2,
):
    # define postprocessors
    postproc = MetadataReplacementPostProcessor(target_metadata_key="window")
    rerank = SentenceTransformerRerank(
        top_n=rerank_top_n, model="BAAI/bge-reranker-base"
    )

    sentence_window_engine = sentence_index.as_query_engine(
        similarity_top_k=similarity_top_k, node_postprocessors=[postproc, rerank]
    )
    return sentence_window_engine
```

对一个特定的问题进行查询并打印结果：

```python
window_response = sentence_window_engine.query(
    "如何开始人工智能个人项目?"
)
str(window_response)
```

<details class="lake-collapse"><summary id="u4022bbd7"><span class="ne-text">output：</span></summary><pre data-language="json" id="FJZ1x" class="ne-codeblock language-json"><code>'通过模仿人类思考模式，尝试逐步推理是一个开始人工智能个人项目的方法。另外，利用概率和经济学概念处理不确定或不完整的信息也是一个成功的方法。在解决困难问题时，寻找更有效的算法是优先考虑的。最终，强调感知运动的重要性也是一个可以考虑的方向。'</code></pre></details>
重置 Trulens 数据库，使用 Trulens 记录器对基于窗口的句子索引进行评估，记录查询结果：

```python
tru.reset_database()

tru_recorder_sentence_window = get_prebuilt_trulens_recorder(
    sentence_window_engine,
    app_id = "Sentence Window Query Engine"

管理者如何管理AI？
Managers can manage AI by considering the following suggestions:
1. Delegate administrative tasks.
2. Focus on enhancing their comprehensive judgment and creativity in the field of analysis and prediction.
3. Treat AI as a colleague and form a collaborative team.
4. Recognize that all technologies, including AI, have limitations and may face bottlenecks.
强人工智能是什么？
强人工智能是一种观点，认为计算机本身具有思维，而不仅仅是用来模拟人类思维的工具。根据这个观点，只要计算机运行适当的程序，它们就具有自己的思维能力。
人工智能被滥用带来的危害？
The misuse of artificial intelligence could potentially lead to violations of copyright laws and other legal regulations. There have been cases where artificial intelligence technology has been used to remove mosaic from explicit videos, alter the appearance of individuals in videos, and other related incidents. Additionally, experts have raised concerns about the potential misuse of artificial intelligence in manipulating financial markets, scientists, human leaders, and even developing weapons that may be beyond human comprehension and control. Furthermore, there are predictions that certain professions could be replaced by machines and artificial intelligence in the future, impacting millions of individuals and potentially leading to social instability.
什么是适合我的人工智能工作?
适合您的人工智能工作是那些需要您具备观察周围环境、作出行动以达成目标的能力，同时能够正确解释外部数据、学习并利用知识实现特定目标和任务的工作。这样的工作可能涉及模仿人类思维相关的认知功能，包括学习和解决问题，并需要您具备感知环境、采取行动以最大程度提高成功机会的能力。</code></pre></details>

人工智能中的先验知识是如何被存储的？
In artificial intelligence, prior knowledge is stored in a way that allows machines to retain descriptions of objectives, features, categories, and relationships between objects. It can also encompass descriptions of events, time, states, causes, results, or any knowledge that one wishes the machine to store. This stored knowledge can include both explicitly provided information and knowledge derived through intelligent reasoning processes.
